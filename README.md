🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as:
Square Footage
Number of Bedrooms
Number of Bathrooms

The goal is to build a simple yet effective machine learning model that can estimate housing prices using these variables. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

📌 Features
Built with Python and Scikit-learn
Uses Linear Regression for prediction
Clean and easy-to-understand code
Ready for experimentation with real estate datasets
